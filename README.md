# Time-series Clustering of KIVA Crowdfunding Loans in Philippines
## Overview
KIVA is a non-profit organization that provides loans to financially excluded and poor communities via field partners through crowdfunding. As KIVA lacks information on the Philippines communities, we apply time-series data mining techniques to understand the various loan lending patterns/behaviors.
- Performed Hierarchical clustering on loan type/region time-stamped data using DTW distance measure between 2014 and 2018. Identified strong and inverse cluster pattern insights which could help KIVA Field Partners strategize their reach to more potential donors..
